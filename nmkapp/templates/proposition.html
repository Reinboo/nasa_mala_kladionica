    {% blocktrans %}Stake is 10€ and money is split among top three places, in 3:2:1 ratios. First place take 50%, second 33.3% and third place 16.6%.{% endblocktrans %}

	{% blocktrans %}NMK will take all provision costs during both receiving and sending money over Paypal. So, if prize 100€, NMK will pay you 103.8€, to cover Paypal provision costs.{% endblocktrans %}

	<li>
        {% blocktrans %}Total prize money is 10% less than total amount of people playing with real money * 10€. This is to cover our provision costs and to pay off for costs of web site, but we are not making profit out of this.{% endblocktrans %}

That's not too much, but as many of us is here &ndash; higher the prize money!

<h1>{% trans "Rules of play" %}</h1>

<ul class="proposition">
	<li>
        {% blocktrans %}You are betting on one whole round. In cup phase, you are betting on each parts separately - eighth-finals, quarterfinals, semifinals and final.{% endblocktrans %}
	<li>
        {% blocktrans %}There is no discrimination, we are taking odds from first booking site that publishes them (this is because we want to enable you to bet as soon as possible), no matter is it Bet365, BWin or some third one. Odds on NMK are <strong>not changing</strong> after initial publishing.{% endblocktrans %}
	</li>
	<li>
        {% blocktrans %}You are betting only on final result (1X2) in regular game time.{% endblocktrans %}
	</li>
	<li>
        {% blocktrans %}All registered account that do not bet on first round will be automatically deleted (not to waste necessary space in standings).{% endblocktrans %}
	</li>
	<li>
        {% blocktrans %}Odds are not multiplied, but summed. If you miss one game, it does not affect your final score from the same round.
You can look at this as you are betting a single ticket for each and every match and your stake is 1 point.
This means, if you guess odd of 3.4, you will get 3.4 points.{% endblocktrans %}
	</li>
	<li>
        {% blocktrans %}You are not able to see other players' bets until you click 'Final Decision'.
After that point, you will be able to see other players' bets, but that doesn't mean they also clicked 'Final Decision', e.g. other players might be able to still modify their respective bets.
Only when first match in round starts, you can consider those bets final bets from all players, as betting is off from that point.{% endblocktrans %}
	</li>
	<li>
        {% blocktrans %}This web site must be available 24/7.
If web site is not available for more than 10 minutes, or we notice any online attacks that can compromise or affect fair competition, whole competition is cancelled and all money is returned to their respective players.{% endblocktrans %}
	</li>
	<li>
        {% blocktrans %}If there are multiple players with same amount of points, they are splitting prize money out of all places they are on.
Example: if John and Jane are first and they have 50 points each, they are splitting prize money for both 1. and 2. place - (50% + 33.3%) / 2 = 41.66%.
If Peter is below them with 49 points, Peter does not get prize money for 2. place, but for the third one, e.g. 16.6%.{% endblocktrans %}
